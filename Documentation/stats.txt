Enterprise value
    EV = market cap + debt - cash
    Example given was. Say you want to buy a 500k house and you make a deposit of 100k and take a loan of 400k
    The equation would look like
    EV = Equity value + Net debt
    500k = 100k + 400k
        
    For example, if two companies have the same market cap then the one with the smaller EV will be the less riskier one as it has less debt.

PEG ratio
    Price/earnings to growth ratio is the p/e ratio divided by the growth
    EPS = Earnings per share
    PEG = Price/(EPS*EPS_growth)
    
    Low is good
    Some say below one is desirable
    
    
price/sales
    p/s = market_cap/revenue(last 12 months)
    If low the share might be undervalued (eg valued low but earning high)
    
price/book
    The price per share divided by the book value per share (BVPS)
    The BPVS is the dollar value if the company dissolved and all assets are liquidated and all debtors are paid.
    Lower could mean undervalued
    OR could mean something is wrong with the company (I assume people that don't know what they're doing running it)

Enterprise value to revenue
    EV/R = EV/revenue
    Lower the better
    
Enterprise value / EBITDA
    Enterprise value (EV) to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)
    A value below 10 is considered good
    Could do a similar thing to EV except use 10 instead of MC
    


Buy signs:
    If EV is less than market cap
        Could get the value of MC - EV for all companies and the one with the largest value is best
        Then normalise
    low PEG
        or under 1
    Low p/s
    low p/b
    low EV/R
    if EV/EBITDA is less than 10
