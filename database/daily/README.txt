This folder (the sub folder, asx, is there just in case I want to include data from other countries too) contains the data scraped from today that is 
required for classification.

Format:
First row contains the colomn headers eg:

company name,company code,last updated,pe ratio,...,...,historic price1,...historic pricen

Then every row from then on is the data in the same format.
